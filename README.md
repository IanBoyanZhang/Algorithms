#### Dynamic Programming
[Dynamic Programming](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs97si/04-dynamic-programming.pdf)
Problem covered
1. 2-D DP
LCS

2. Given a string x = x1....n, find the minimum number of characters that need to be inserted to make it a palindrome

Alternate solution
Reverse x to get x^R

The answer is n-L where L is the length of the LCS of x and x^R
